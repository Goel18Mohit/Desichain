    <string name="ans1">Place a return request online conveniently if your product is damaged, tampered, defective, not as described state. The product can be replaced only based on valid reasons. You can write an email to us within 10 days of the delivery of the product regarding your product returns at: orders@desichain.in   \nBuyer has to bear all expenses for returning. Please ensure that you pack the Order securely and send it back to us through Regular Postal Service or a reliable Courier Service. Desichain is not responsible for any kind of in-transit damages, while the product has been shipped by the customer. A customer is solely responsible for the damage claim from courier company after he dispatched to us.</string>
    <string name="ans2">You can change any sealed product (after a ‘Return-acceptance’ mail from Desichain) that has not been opened and is left as it is. Please ensure that the product is in original condition from the packaging to the price tags, labels, freebies, accessories and original packaging. However, we don’t allow returns merely on not liking the product as most products are daily consumable product. Kindly refer next point for more details.</string>
    <string name="ans3">Certain situations wherein it is difficult for the returns/ refund to take place are listed below:   \n1) If the product is tampered or seal is opened and used.   \n\n2) If the return request is made after the specific time frame.   \n\n3) If the product is damaged due to use (or normal wear and tear) or product is not in the same condition as you received it. Any negligence on customer’s part is not acceptable.   \n\n4) If product is tampered or missing serial numbers in our inspection of the Images/ Videos sent by customer to our Quality Analysts.\n\n5) If anything is missing from the package including price tag, labels, accessories and outer packaging.   \n\n6) Food Items and Clothing don’t fall in our return policy.</string>
    <string name="ans4">Yes. The free gift is a part of the placed order. Hence, it is required to be returned with the originally delivered order.</string>
    <string name="ans5">Yeah, a part means an \'Individual Item’, and not a part/ accessories of that particular item.   \nFor eg: Drops returned without dropper aren’t acceptable as dropper is an accessory. Only a complete Item can be returned. And not parts of the items.   \nBut if you have placed an order for multiple items, and have complain with any one particular item of the order, you can apply request for the return of the same.</string>
    <string name="ans6">We work to provide you a hassle free shopping experience. Refunds are issued when (after inspection):   \n\n1) We cannot provide replacement.   \n\n2) When the product is damaged or missing.   \n\n3) Only after return delivery of the product(s) at our office address.   \nThe Refund would be issued in 10-15 days and should reflect in your Bank account in next 4-7 working days per your individual Bank’s procedure. \nWe don’t provide return of shipping charges.</string>
    <string name="ans7">If you have paid by Credit/ Debit/ Net banking/ PayTm/ Mobikwik, then it could be refunded without requiring any bank information from your end.   \nIf you paid by Cash On Delivery (COD)/ Cash and Cheque deposit/ NEFT etc, you would need to share your bank details with us.</string>
    <string name="ans8">Yes, We at DesiChain strive hard to give an excellent shopping experience to our customers.   \nYour problem will be understood and required procedure will follow within 48 hours of the complaint.</string>
